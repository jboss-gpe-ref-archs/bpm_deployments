Standalone Complex Event Processing Quickstart using JBoss BRM Suite 6.1 libraries

== Overview

Red Hat sells subscriptions to its fully supported Business Rules Management System (BRMS).
The default deployment of this product is as a web application executing on the JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP).
Interaction to this _BRMS server_ is typically via its REST APIs.
This default _BRMS server_ deployment topology is ideal for many large enterprise scenarios where it is ideal to have the rules engine centralized, optimized and configured for high-availability.

Red Hat's BRMS product is, however, also fully supported when embedded directly in a business application.
The business application would, in this case, make direct use of the {droolsjavadoc}.

=== Purpose
The purpose of this quickstart is to demonstrate creation and execution of a mavenized _Complex Event Processing_ (CEP) project using supported JBoss BRMS libraries.
This CEP project could then be leveraged in the source code of a business application that is need of embedding BRMS and invoking its CEP engine.

=== Prerequisites

. Experience with the rules and CEP engines of BRMS
+
The CEP engine is discussed in length in Red Hat GPE's _Business Logic Developer_ course.
+
In addition, the following is developer documentation on {cepdocs} using BRMS.
. maven v3.0.3 (or more recent) installed on your local workstation
. JDK 1.7 (or more recent) installed on your local workstation

== Configure Local Maven Repositories
This project will make use of JBoss BRMS 6.1 libraries.

[NOTE]
JBoss BRMS 6.1 is currently available as part of the _Early Adopter_ program.
Contact your Red Hat account manager to apply to this _Early Adopter_ program.

=== Acquire Red Hat Maven Repositories
This quickstart will make use of supported Maven repositories installed on your local workstation.
In particular, the following is needed:

. jboss-brms-bpmsuite-6.1.0.GA-maven-repository.zip

[NOTE]
While BRMS 6.1 is only available from the _Early Adopter_ program, request this zip of mavenized BRMS libraries from your Red Hat account manager.

Once downloaded, unzip :

-----
unzip jboss-brms-bpmsuite-6.1.0.GA-maven-repository.zip -d /path/to/repo
-----

[NOTE]
Replace _/path/to/repo_ with your preferred location on your local workstation for managing Maven repositories.

=== Maven settings.xml

The BxMS Maven repo includes a sample settings.xml at:

-----
/path/to/repo/jboss-brms-bpmsuite-6.1.0.GA-redhat-1-maven-repository/example-settings.xml
-----

In your favorite text editor, open that file and make the following changes:

. Modify all occurrences of BRMS release #
.. *OLD Value*: _jboss-brms-bpmsuite-6.1.0.GA-redhat-1-maven-repository_
.. *NEW Value*: _jboss-brms-bpmsuite-6.1.0.GA-redhat-3-maven-repository_

. Modify path to unzipped local BxMS repo

== Create Maven Project

. Create a simple CEP project with dependencies on supported BxMS libraries:
+
-----
mvn archetype:generate \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.kie \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=kie-drools-archetype \
    -DgroupId=org.acme \
    -DartifactId=drools_cep \
    -Dversion=1.0 \
    -DexampleWithCEP \
    -DpomEclipseCompatible \
    -Dslf4jVersion=1.7.2 \
    -DinteractiveMode=false \
    -DdroolsVersion=6.2.0.Final-redhat-3
-----
+
After a while (depending on download speeds of your network), a new directory called _drools_cep_ should be created.
. cd drools_cep
. mvn clean install -DskipTests -s /path/to/repo/example-settings.xml
+
This command will compile and install the _drools_cep_ project.

== Execute Standalone CEP Test
The new mavenized _drools_cep_ project previously created contains a JUnit test class that demonstrates use of the BRMS CEP engine.
Execute this test as follows:

. cd /path/to/new/drools_cep
. mvn clean test
+
In your terminal window, you should see the following :
+
-----

-----

Congratulations!  You have successfully created and executed a simple BRMS project that makes use of the CEP engine.

== Review pertinent project artifacts:

=== pom.xml

The _drools_cep/pom.xml_ defines dependencies and versions that you'll want to include in the maven configurations of your business application.

. *drools-version*
+
Notice that the value corresponds to the _droolsVersion_ system property specified previously when the maven archetype command was executed:
+
-----
 <drools-version>6.2.0.Final-redhat-3</drools-version>
-----

. *dependencyManagement*
+
The supported BxMS supported Maven repository includes a single bill of materials (BOM) artifact that greatly simplifies configuration of maven dependencies.
+
