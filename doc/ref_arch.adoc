== BPM Suite 6 Deployment

:numbered:

== Pre-Requisites
== Overview
The purpose of the reference architecture is to do a deep dive into BPM Suite 6 deployment topics of interest. 
The topics addressed are based on need or partner requests. The following topics are covered or planned:



== KIE module types
=== FileKieModule
=== MemoryKieModule
=== ZipKieModule

== Deployment Options
Deployments are KieModule JARs which can be deployed or undeployed.  The Business-Central application of BPM Suite 6 provides a User Interface (UI) for managing deployments.
For many organizations, this means of deployment is only suitable for development.  Production and test environments often require more automated deployment means.
This reference architecture describes these additional means of deploying Kie projects. 


=== Kie-Scanner Deployment
To understand Kie-Scanner deployment, Maven repositories must be discussed first.

Maven can either 'mvn install' to deploy a KieModule to the local machine, where all other applications on the local machine use it. 
Or it can 'mvn deploy' to push the KieModule to a remote Maven repository. Building the Application will pull in the KieModule and 
populate the local Maven repository.

After a KieModule is built, JARs can be deployed in one of two ways. A KieModule is either added to the classpath, like any other JAR in a Maven dependency listing, 
or a KieModule can be dynamically loaded at runtime.  The terms `classpath deployment` and `dynamic deployment` will be used to designate these two means of loading
a KieModule on a BPM Suite 6 server. 

For classpath deployment, KIE will scan the classpath to find all the JARs with a kmodule.xml in it. Each found JAR is represented by the KieModule interface. The
Kie-Scanner project, discussed below will provide an example of classpath deployment. 

The REST Deployment, discussed below, is one exmaple of dynamic deployment. Dynamic deployment can also be done through the business-central UI.
While dynamic modules supports side by side versioning, classpath modules do not. 
Further once a module is on the classpath, no other version may be loaded dynamically.

==== Comparison: KModuleDeploymentService and KieScanner
. why doesn't the Execution Server just use KIE scanner to detect the deployment / undeployment of the latest KIE jars


==== REST Deployment
The execution server within BPM Suite 6 provides a REST API that may be used to manage deployments.

Configuration options, such as the runtime strategy, should be specified when deploying the deployment: the configuration of a deployment can not be changed after it has already been deployed.

.Deployment via REST template
----------
curl -vv -u <user-id>:<user-password> -X POST http://<host>:<port>/business-central/rest/deployment/<deployment-id>/deploy?strategy=<runtime-strategy>
----------

- *<userId>* is the application user for BPM Suite 6
- *<user-password>* is the password for the above user
- *<host>* is the hostname or IP address for BPM Suite 6
- *<port>* is the port required for BPM Suite 6 (http or https port)
- *<deployment-id>* is an expression that contains the following elements, separated by a : character:
* group id
* artifact id
* version
* (optional) kbase id
* (optional) ksession id
- *<runtime-strategy>* is one of the three available runtime strategies of BPM Suite 6
* SINGLETON
* PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE
* PER_PROCESS

[NOTE]
.Runtime Strategies
==========
The session strategies have corresponding CDI annotations of @Singleton, @PerProcessInstance and @PerRequest. 
Their names refer to how the session context is managed. 

- `SINGLETON` maintains a single session context across all requests  
- `PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE` keeps session (context) for a process instance 
- `PER_PROCESS` is just stateless, no state is kept
==========

The following is an example use of the REST API to deploy a Kie Module.

.Deployment via REST Example
----------
curl -vv -u myUserId:myPassword -X POST http://localhost:8080/business-central/rest/deployment/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0:bpmsignalling_base:bpmsignalling_session/deploy?strategy=PER_PROCESS_INSTANCE
----------

The REST call to undeploy a Kie project follows the same pattern, but without the strategy parameter

.Un-Deployment via REST template
----------
curl -vv -u <user-id>:<user-password> -X POST http://<host>:<port>/business-central/rest/deployment/<deployment-id>/undeploy
----------

Curl was used in the above examples, but the REST API enables any application with http client libraries to manage deployments via REST,
providing many options for managing deployments.

[WARNING]
.Deploy and Undeploy are asynchronous
==========
Both the /deploy and /undeploy operations are asynchronous REST operations.  This means that although each of these calls will typically return a status of 202 upon completion,
the requested operaiton has not been completed.  So the actual operation may actually fail.
==========

To determine that the REST call completed the deployment or undeployment call, use a REST, GET operation call to `/deployment/` to return a list of all available deployed
instances:

.Check the list of deployments
----------
curl -vv -u <user-id>:<user-password> -X GET http://<host>:<port>/business-central/rest/deployment/
----------

== Deploy to a Nexus repository
"Build & Deploy" performs a "maven install" and a "maven deploy".
Any additional repositories defined in the project's pom 
<distributionManagement> section are honoured (with appropriate 
authentication credentials taken from settings.xml's <repository> elements)


. start local nexus
. start business-central ver 6.0.2
. create project in business-central
. clone the repo to a local environment
. add distribuitonMagt on the pom.xml

+
-----
<distributionManagement>
   <repository>
      <id>deployment</id>
      <name>Internal Releases</name>
      <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/releases/</url>
   </repository>
   <snapshotRepository>
     <id>deployment</id>
     <name>Internal Releases</name>
     <url>http://localhost:8081/nexus/content/repositories/snapshots/</url>
  </snapshotRepository>
</distributionManagement>
-----
    
. push changes to business-central repo
. click "build and deploy" on business central,  it deploys to remote nexus repository.
