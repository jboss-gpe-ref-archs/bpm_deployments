== BPM Suite 6: GPE Extensions

:numbered:

== Overview
The purpose of this portion of the *bpm_deployments* reference architecture is to demonstrate how to extend the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server to expose one or more functions useful during deployment and/or runtime. 

Currently, the GPE Extensions project provides the following additional functions :

. *listProcesses*
+
Given a deploymentId, return an array (in JSON format) of ids of BPMN2 processes that have previously been registered with the KieBase of a deployment unit.

. *getActiveNodeInfo*
+
Given a deploymentId and process instance Id, return an XML list of _ActiveNodeInfo_ elements.
This function is useful for diagraming the current state of process instances. 


== Pre-Requisites

. ssh client
. maven 3.0.5 (or greater)
. git client
. curl
. familiarity with {bpmproduct}
. proficiency with basic *nix command line
. a BPM Suite 6 run-time environment such as that provided by the {osebpms} or {dockerbpms} projects

== Set-up

=== local:  Clone this reference architecture

This reference architecture needs to be cloned in your local computer only.
To do so, execute the following:

--------
git clone https://github.com/jboss-gpe-ref-archs/bpm_deployments.git
--------

Doing so will create a directory in your local computer called:  *bpm_deployments*.
For the purposes of this documentation, this directory will be referred to as $REF_ARCH_HOME.

=== local: Build the Reference Architecture
The $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions directory contains sub-modules that extend the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server:

. *gpe-common*
+
Contains a Java interface that defines functions that extend the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.

. *gpe-kie-remote*
+
Contains a CDI bean, EJB service and JAX-RS based RESTful resource.
This functionality builds off each-other.
The CDI bean directly extends the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.
The EJB service is a wrapper around the CDI bean, introduces transaction boundaries and provides a light-weight remoting API that EJB clients can invoke (optional).
The JAX-RS is a wrapper around the EJB service and exposes GPE Extension functions as RESTful resources.

To build the gpe-extensions project, execute the following:
 
. cd $REF_ARCH_HOME
. mvn clean install -DskipTests

+
The end result are the following jar files:

** $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-common/target/gpe-common-deployment.jar
** $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-kie-remote/target/gpe-kie-remote.jar


=== local:  deploy GPE Extension artifacts

The GPE Extension artifacts that were previously built need to be deployed to the java classpath of BPM Suite 6 .
Do so as follows using the secure copy utility:

-----
scp $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-common/target/gpe-common-deployment.jar  <ssh.url.to.your.bpm.environment>:~/bpms/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
scp $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-common/target/gpe-kie-remote.jar  <ssh.url.to.your.bpm.environment>:~/bpms/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
----- 

Afterwards, bounce your BPM Suite 6 java process.
Once BPM Suite 6 starts back up, check the log file at $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/log/server.log for entries similar to the following:

-----
INFO  [org.jboss.as.ejb3.deployment.processors.EjbJndiBindingsDeploymentUnitProcessor] (MSC service thread 1-6) JNDI bindings for session bean named kieService in deployment unit deployment "business-central.war" are as follows:

        java:global/business-central/kieService!org.kie.services.remote.IGPEKieService
        java:app/business-central/kieService!org.kie.services.remote.IGPEKieService
        java:module/kieService!org.kie.services.remote.IGPEKieService
        java:global/business-central/kieService
        java:app/business-central/kieService
        java:module/kieService

-----

This log entry indicates the GPE Extension EJB has been bound to JNDI and all is well.
We are now ready to test the new functionality.

== *List Processes* Test

.  Log into the BPM Console of BPM Suite 6 and either create or use an existing KIE project.
.  If the KIE project does not already include BPMN2 process definitions, create a few (doesn't have to be elaborate).
.. Make note of the Ids of your various BPMN2 processes.
.  Deploy your KIE project via the *Build and Deploy* button provided by the _Project Explorer_ panel of BPM Console.
.. Make note of the maven GroupId, ArtifactId and Version (GAV) identifier of the deployed project
.  In your local environment, execute the following RESTful query:

-----
curl -v -u jboss:brms -X GET <bpm-server-url>/business-central/rest/GPEKieResource/<project-GAV>/processes
-----

** Replace <server-url> with the actual URL of your remote BPM Suite 6 server
** Replace <project-GAV> with the actual GAV of your project

The HTTP response payload from invoking the new RESTful resource should include a list of ids (in JSON array format) of BPMN2 processes that have been registered with the KieBase corresponding to your Kie Project.
These process Ids should correspond with what was identified in step #2.


== *GetActiveNodeInfo* Test

. Log into the BPM Console of BPM Suite 6 and clone, build & deploy the {bpmsignalling}.
. Start an instance of the _ConcurrentPInstanceSignal_ BPMN2 process definition.
. Make note of the Id of the new process instance.
. Notice that the process instance now has 3 active nodes.

+

. To retrieve an XML list of these active nodes, execute the following :

-----
curl -v -u jboss:brms -X GET <bpm-server_url>:8080/business-central/rest/GPEKieResource/com.redhat.gpe.refarch.bpm_signalling:processTier:1.0/process/activenodes/<pInstanceId>
-----

. The response body returned to the client should include a list of active node information.
This information is needed to diagram the state of a process instance.

        <activeNode>
