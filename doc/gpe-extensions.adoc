== BPM Suite 6: GPE Extensions

:numbered:

== Overview
The purpose of this portion of the BPM Suite 6 reference architecture is to demonstrate how to extend the BPM Suite 6 Exectuion Server to expose one or more functions useful during deployment and/or runtime. 

Currently, this GPE Extensions functionality extends the BPM Suite Execution Server with the following :

. *listProcesses*
+
Given a deploymentId, return a JSON list of ids of BPMN2 process definitions that have previously been registered with the KieBase of a deployment unit.


== Pre-Requisites

. ssh client
. maven 3.0.5 (or greater)
. git client
. curl
. familiarity with {bpmproduct}
. proficiency with basic *nix command line
. a BPM Suite 6 run-time environment such as that provided by the {dockerbpms} project

== Set-up

=== local:  Clone this reference architecture

This reference architecture will be cloned in your local computer only.
To clone this reference architecture in your local environment, execute the following:

--------
git clone https://github.com/jboss-gpe-ref-archs/bpm_deployments.git
--------

Doing so will create a directory in your local computer called:  bpm_deployments.
For the purposes of this documentation, this directory will be referred to as $REF_ARCH_HOME.

=== local: Build the Reference Architecture
The $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions directory contains sub-modules that extend the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server:

. *gpe-common*
+
Contains a Java interface that defines functions that extend the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.

. *gpe-kie-remote*
+
Contains a CDI bean, EJB service and JAX-RS based RESTful resource.
This functionality builds off each-other.
The CDI bean directly extends the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server.
The EJB service is a wrapper around the CDI bean, introduces transaction boundaries and provides a light-weight remoting API that EJB clients can choose to invoke (optional).
The JAX-RS is a wrapper around the EJB service and exposes the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server with additional RESTful resource functions.

To build the gpe-extensions project, execute the following:
 
. cd $REF_ARCH_HOME
. mvn clean install -DskipTests

+
The end result are the following jar files:

. $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-common/target/gpe-common-deployment.jar
. $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-kie-remote/target/gpe-kie-remote.jar


=== local:  deploy GPE Extension artifacts

The GPE Extension artifacts that were previously built need to be deployed to the java classpath of BPM Suite 6 .
Do so as follows using the secure copy utility:

-----
scp $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-common/target/gpe-common-deployment.jar  <ssh.url.to.your.bpm.environment>:~/bpms/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
scp $REF_ARCH_HOME/gpe-extensions/gpe-common/target/gpe-kie-remote.jar  <ssh.url.to.your.bpm.environment>:~/bpms/standalone/deployments/business-central.war/WEB-INF/lib
----- 

Afterwards, bounce your BPM Suite 6 java process.
Once BPM Suite 6 starts back up, check the log file at $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/log/server.log for entries similar to the following:

-----
INFO  [org.jboss.as.ejb3.deployment.processors.EjbJndiBindingsDeploymentUnitProcessor] (MSC service thread 1-6) JNDI bindings for session bean named kieService in deployment unit deployment "business-central.war" are as follows:

        java:global/business-central/kieService!org.kie.services.remote.IGPEKieService
        java:app/business-central/kieService!org.kie.services.remote.IGPEKieService
        java:module/kieService!org.kie.services.remote.IGPEKieService
        java:global/business-central/kieService
        java:app/business-central/kieService
        java:module/kieService

-----

This log entry indicates the GPE Extension EJB has been bound to JNDI and all is well.
We are now ready to test the new functionality.

== *List Processes* Test

.  Log into the BPM Console and BPM Suite 6 and either create or use an existing KIE project.
.  If the KIE project does not already include BPMN2 process definitions, create a few (doesn't have to be elaborate).
.. Make note of the Ids of your various BPMN2 processes.
.  Deploy your KIE project via the *Build and Deploy* mechanism provided by the _Project Explorer_ panel of BPM Console.
.. Make note of the maven GroupId, ArtifactId and Version (GAV) identifier of the deployed project
.  In your local environment, execute the following RESTful query:

-----
curl -v -u jboss:brms -X GET <server-url>/business-central/rest/GPEKieResource/<project-GAV>/processes
-----

.. Replace <server-url> with the actual URL of your remote BPM Suite 6 server
.. Replace <project-GAV> with the actual GAV of your project

The HTTP response payload from invoking the new RESTful resource should include a list of ids (in JSON array format) of BPMN2 processes that have been registered with the KieBase corresponding to your Kie Project.
