== PURPOSE:
The purpose of the reference architecture is to do a deep dive into BPM Suite 6 deployment topics of interest. 
The topics addressed are based on need or partner requests.  The following topics are covered or planned:

* kie-scanner
* upcoming deployment descriptor (that allows for in-memory kiesession)

== OVERVIEW:
In BRMS 5.x, processes were stored in packages produced by Guvnor and then downloaded by jbpm console for execution using the  Knowledge Agent. 

BPM Suite 6, moves away from proprietary packages in favor of, well known and mature, Apache Maven based packaging, known as knowledge archives or kjar. 
Business assets, such as process definitions, rules, java classes, etc. are now part of a simple jar file built and managed by Maven. 
A kjar can have defined dependencies on other Maven artifacts including other kjars. 

The Maven archive structure opens up new deployment options in BPM Suite 6.  Many of these options are explained in the documentation for this
reference architecture found in the {ref_arch_doc}.
