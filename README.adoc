== OVERVIEW:
This reference architecture is comprised of several sub-projects related to BPM Suite 6 deployment:

. *{gpe-extensions}*
+
The purpose of this portion of the *bpm_deployments* reference architecture is to demonstrate how to extend the BPM Suite 6 Execution Server to expose functions related to creation of process instance state graphs. 
This ability was available in BRMS 5.3.1.
However, as of BPM Suite 6.0.3, equivalent functionality is not included out-of-the-box.

. *{multi-tenant-bpm}*
+
A BPM Suite 6 deployment in a production environment could potentially be multi-tenant.
In other words, rules and BPMN2 process definitions for multiple client-organizations could potentially be managed by the same BPM Suite 6 server.
Users from one client-organization should only have visibility to their BPM design-time artifacts.
+
The purpose of this portion of the *bpm_deployments* reference architecture is to introduce an example of a multi-tenant BPM Suite 6 production environment.

. *{lean-exec-server}*
+
A BPM Suite 6 deployment suitable for development and testing environments is often different than a deployment suitable for a production environment.
+
The purpose of this portion of the *bpm_deployments* reference architecture is to introduce the configuration and deployment of a lean BPM Suite 6 Execution Server suitable for a production environment.
